# PLAN-2 / PLAN-3 execution progress

Updated: 2026-07-02 21:50 Asia/Seoul

## Goal

- Add deterministic MCP workflow replay evaluation, then split the two MCP monolith entrypoints without changing public behavior.

## Scope

- In scope: PLAN-2 canonical replay and measured metrics; PLAN-3 module extraction; versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1; docs and CI synchronization.
- Out of scope: MCP contract changes, new product features, pushes, pull requests, tags, publishing, and packaging.

## Current state

- Done: PLAN-2 release and PLAN-3 pre-refactor contract baseline.
- Partial: none.
- Not started: PLAN-3 production module slices.
- Blocked: none.

## Decisions

- PLAN-2 precedes PLAN-3 so replay becomes a refactor safety net.
- PLAN-2 ships canonical five scenarios and classifies all 39 declared tasks.
- PLAN-3 keeps both entrypoints and every new production module below 5,000 lines.
- New production modules stay flat under `src/lib` so current MODULE_MAP drift checks cover them.
- `SKILLS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` is user-owned untracked work and must not be staged.

## Files and areas

- Read: project workflow rules, both plans, eval matrix, MCP client harness, CI, TypeScript build config, monolith route boundaries.
- Changed: PLAN-2 replay/CI/docs/version files plus the PLAN-3 contract runner, golden fingerprints, Node build entry, and API test harness import.
- Likely next: commit the contract baseline, then begin the low-coupling tool-description extraction.

## Validation

- Run: lint, typecheck, static agent eval, MCP test, and packaged replay pass; replay completed in 11.8 seconds with all measured ratios at 1.0 and zero wrong-target incidents.
- Regression proof: redirecting active lorebook reads to a nonexistent route reduced route accuracy and first-pass success to 0.6 and failed the measured gate; restoring the route returned all metrics to 1.0 with no source diff.
- Contract baseline: four `tools/list` profiles and 18 normalized HTTP list/read/write/error responses pass byte-count, SHA-256, and top-level key-order checks.
- Known external failure: the full unit suite has two failures in skill catalog expectations caused by concurrent user-owned skill metadata changes; 105 files and 2,013 tests passed.

## Next steps

1. Commit the PLAN-3 contract baseline.
2. Extract tool description constants and verify the frozen contracts before proceeding.
